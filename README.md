# What have I worked on recently?

### AWS Templates
> I have a habbit of constantly starting and working on MANY new projects all the time. In doing so I learned some valuable lessons. One of them being the value of having a solid starting foundation to build a robust system ontop of. Looking around I had trouble finding simple boilerplates for relatively easy but monotonous things. Enter a bunch of AWS templates I created to support others with this :)

# Where did all the repo's & commits go?
I did a large purge of old repositories (**~30+**) due to either a lack in quality, no longer being maintained/working, and it not reflecting standards I hold today. Everything that is no longer maintained but I want to keep for sentimental sake will be archived to indicate as such :)
