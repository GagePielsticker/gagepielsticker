# Where did all the repo's & commits go?
I did a large purge of old repositories (**~30+**) due to either a lack in quality, no longer being maintained/working, and it not reflecting standards I hold today. Everything that is no longer maintained but I want to keep for sentimental sake will be archived to indicate as such :)
